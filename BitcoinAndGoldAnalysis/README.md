# Gold vs Bitcoin: A Data-Driven Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
For centuries, Gold has been considered a safe-haven asset, protecting investors during inflation and times of uncertainty. In contrast, Bitcoin has emerged in the past decade with the bold claim of being the “digital gold” of the 21st century.  

This project applies **data science techniques in Python** to analyze over **10 years of historical market data** for Gold and Bitcoin. The goal is to explore whether Bitcoin truly behaves like Gold—or if it is a fundamentally different asset.

## Methods & Techniques
The analysis uses Python with libraries like **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn** to explore:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Resampling daily and weekly prices  

2. **Return Calculations**  
   - Daily log returns  
   - Weekly log returns  

3. **Volatility Analysis**  
   - Daily and weekly volatility (annualized)  
   - Rolling 30-day volatility  

4. **Correlation**  
   - Daily and weekly correlations between Gold and Bitcoin  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Price trends over time  
   - Daily return series  
   - Rolling volatility plots

## Key Insights
- **Gold** is stable, with annualized volatility around **15%**.  
- **Bitcoin** is much riskier, with volatility around **60%+**, but offers higher average returns.  
- **Correlation** between Gold and Bitcoin is very low (~0.06–0.08), suggesting they move independently.  
- This makes Gold a **stabilizer** and Bitcoin a **speculative growth asset** in a portfolio.
